# **App Name**: SefSheet

## Core Features:

- Cell Grid Display: Render a scrollable grid of cells with row and column headers, similar to a spreadsheet application.
- Navigation & Selection: Enable users to navigate using keyboard and mouse, selecting single cells, multiple cells, entire rows, columns, or the whole sheet.
- Cell Value Entry: Allow users to input and edit alphanumeric values directly into a single selected cell.
- Basic Text Formatting: Provide controls to change the font family, font size, and text styling (bold, italics, underline) for selected cells.
- Cell Color Formatting: Allow users to set foreground (text) and background colors for selected cells.

## Style Guidelines:

- A light color scheme to maximize readability and reduce eye strain for extended use.
- Primary accent color: Professional purple (#8033CC). This color will be used for interactive elements, highlights, and primary branding to convey organization and modern functionality without being overly playful or corporate cliché.
- Background color: A very light, desaturated purple (#F2F0F5), providing a clean, spacious canvas for data while maintaining brand coherence with the primary color.
- Secondary accent color: A vibrant blue (#4747EB), chosen to be analogous to the primary purple. It will be used for subtle emphasis on certain UI components, call-to-actions, or error states, providing clear visual contrast.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for its modern, legible, and objective characteristics, which are ideal for data-dense applications requiring clarity across various content types.
- Utilize a set of simple, clear, and consistently styled line icons for formatting tools and selection indicators. Icons should be easily understandable and non-distracting to maintain focus on data.
- A clean, grid-centric layout with subtle cell borders and clear differentiation between active, selected, and unselected cells. Toolbars should be minimalistic and functional, placed intuitively.
- Subtle and quick animations for cell selection and input, providing smooth visual feedback without hindering user efficiency or creating a distracting experience.
